# Controlled Walk of Two Persons
The Controlled Walk of 1st Person and random Walk of 2nd Person program is a simulation built in Java that models the movement of people in a confined space. The program is designed to show how a person walking with intention and control can navigate a space more efficiently than two people who are not in control of their movements.
 The user can control the movements of one person using the keyboard, while the movements of the 2nd  people are generated randomly by the program.
The program is designed to be educational, helping to illustrate the principles of controlled movement and how they can be applied in real-world situations. It is also a fun way to test different scenarios and see how different walking strategies can affect the movement of people in a confined space.
